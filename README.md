# CSV to JSON
## Convert csv files to json files  
A simulated database was created randomly, with Excel in csv format. Afterwards, the conversion was carried out using the Python and JavaScript languages, separately by directories.  
The csv file is located in the root folder, named fakedb.csv, and the files generated by the scripts for each language can be found in the respective folders named fakedb.json.
